# Backup and Restore Exercise

In this exercise, I've created a new database and  populated it with one table. Then using the Microsoft SSMS, I've created a full backup and performed a restore on this database.

Using the built-in generate scripts feature, I've generated Query scripts that performs the equivalent operations, which can be executed in the future without using GUI.
