### 1. Database Migration

Database migration capstone project. Tasks involved in this project are:

- Schema design
- Handle NULLs and duplicates
- Create a master table that will hold the entire dataset.
- Normalize the dataset into third normal form.
- Identify primary and foreign keys for your tables.
- Use JOIN to create a consolidated table

### 2. Normalization

In this project, I modified a dataset to practice normalization on a complex dataset with lots of duplicate values. I've normalized a simplified dataset to it's 3rd normal form. 

### 3. Backup and Restore

In this exercise, I've created a new database and  populated it with one table. Then using the Microsoft SSMS, I created a full backup and performed a restore on this database.
